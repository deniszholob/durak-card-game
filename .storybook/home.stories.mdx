Storybook helps you build UI components from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states.
Save the UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing or QA

Build UIs with a [**component driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process starting with atomic components and ending with pages
